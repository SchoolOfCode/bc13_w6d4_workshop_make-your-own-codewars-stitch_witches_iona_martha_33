/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Welcome to Spin Us A Yarn, a knit-it-yourself workshop! Select your size and design to work out 
how many balls of wool you will need to make your jumper.

Sizes: S = 600g, M = 800g, L 1kg, XL 1.2kg

1 ball of wool weighs 200g.

You will have to buy a whole ball of a colour even if you only need 20g worth.

Write a function to determine how many balls of wool you will need in total for a specified design and size.

Cat Design: [10% black, 40% periwinkle, 40% orange, 5% white, 5% green]
Rabbit Design: [10% black, 10% periwinkle, 0% orange, 40% white, 40% green]
Fox Design: [10% black, 35% periwinkle, 45% orange, 5% white, 5% green]

Let's get knitting!
