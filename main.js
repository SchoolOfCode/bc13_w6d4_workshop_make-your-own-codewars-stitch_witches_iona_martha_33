/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Welcome to Spin Us A Yarn, a knit-it-yourself workshop! Select your size and design to work out 
how many balls of wool you will need to make your jumper.
However, you already have some of the colours in your wool stash, namely: 100g of black, and 200g of periwinkle.

Sizes: S = 600g, M = 800g, L 1kg, XL 1.2kg

1 ball of wool weighs 200g.

This means that you will have to buy a whole ball of a colour even if you only need 20g worth.

Write a function to determine how many balls of wool you will need in total for a specified design and size.

Cat Design: [10% black, 40% periwinkle, 40% orange, 5% pink, 5% white]
Rabbit Design: [40% white, 10% periwinkle, 15% pink, 10% black, 25% green]
Fox Design: [10% black, 45% red, 10% pink, 35% green]


800 total
black = 80g, umber = 320, red = 40g, pink = 80g, green = 280
black = 1, umber = 2, red = 1, pink = 1, green = 2
total wool balls: 7

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
function ballsOfWool (size, design){
if (size === "S"){
    let weight = 600
} 
else if (size === "M"){
    let weight = 800
} 
else if (size === "L"){
    let weight = 1000
} 
else if (size === "XL"){
    let weight = 1200
}
